# busReg_capstone

This is our capstone project about Business Registration on Tarlac City

- We are the students of the College of Computer Studies - Tarlac State University 

- We recently graduated and continue this system for the requirements

- This is a complete rework of the system


    This system allow business owners to register their business to get their permit online. 
    By creating an account and input their information then submitting the required documents.
    The LGU can then check the information and the documents then schedule the users for an 
    appointment to get their permit.
